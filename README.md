## 👋 About Me

I am a **Software Engineer with 2+ years of professional experience** building scalable, high-performance, user-focused web applications.

My primary focus is **frontend development** using **React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit**, and modern UI frameworks. I have worked on **production-level HR and AI-driven platforms**, where I emphasized clean architecture, performance optimization, and maintainable code.

I enjoy solving real-world problems, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and continuously learning to stay aligned with modern web technologies.
